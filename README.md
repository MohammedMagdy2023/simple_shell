# Simple Shell Project

This is the Simple Shell project for the ALX's Software Engineering Course. This project involves creating a simple UNIX command interpreter, also known as a shell, in the C programming language.

## Description

The Simple Shell project is a group project aimed at implementing a basic shell that can interpret and execute UNIX commands. The shell should mimic the behavior of the standard `/bin/sh` shell, including error messages.
